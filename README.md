# AI-Augmented Breast Biopsy Diagnostics

## Overview
This repository contains materials related to a scholarly and practical project on enhancing breast biopsy interpretation using artificial intelligence and digital pathology tools. The initiative is part of a broader effort to improve diagnostic turnaround times, streamline workflows for pathologists, and optimize the use of immunohistochemistry in breast cancer diagnostics.

## Contents

### ðŸ“„ Abstract (DOCX and PDF Formats)
- **Title:** *AI-Driven Platform for Streamlined Breast Biopsy Interpretation: Enhancing Turnaround Time and Clinical Workflow in Digital Pathology*
- **Authors:** Kathleen Ashbaker, Rustin Soraki, Tara Krishnan, Maria T. Nelson, Carol Rizkalla, Mark Kilgore, Jonathan C. Henriksen, Kareem Hosny
- **Institutions:** University of Washington, Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Pathology, and Computer Science & Engineering

#### ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:
- Leverages **Multi-Scale Co-Attention Convolutional Neural Networks** for analyzing whole slide pathology images.
- Automates immunohistochemistry (IHC) ordering for **neoplastic breast lesions**, stratified into in situ and invasive subtypes (e.g., DCIS, LCIS, IDC, ILC).
- Expected to reduce turnaround times by **~1 day**, enabling same-day diagnostic reporting.
- Achieves high classification accuracy (AUC ~0.98â€“0.99) and strong precision/recall for rare subtypes like LCIS.

### ðŸ“Ž Files
- `KAshbaker_Abstract.pdf` â€“ Presentation version of the abstract including visual aids, performance metrics, and outcome highlights.
- `Abstract_AI-Driven_Platform.docx` â€“ Manuscript-style abstract formatted for submission or formal review.
